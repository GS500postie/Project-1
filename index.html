    <h1>Hi. This is my blog</h1>
    <p>
      It is a journey starting right from scratch and we are just going to
      design some web pages and see how it goes. Don't know if I'm going to make
      this the main one but I need to get some practical skills going and I need
      to-I don't know- just muddle my way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficult thing is bridging the gap between passive learning and
      active application. If you think about it, I'm not going to learn stuff
      unless I do it the hard way, but I have a lot of knowledge at my disposal,
      and should really use it. And also, I have to construct a cheatsheet I can
      refer to for starting new projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also need to start lots of projects and maybe design folder templates
      for those projects. Lot's of work, but this is web design, and this is the
      only way I'm going to get tangible skills.
    </p>
    <p>Also, this is an ULTRALEARNING project</p>
