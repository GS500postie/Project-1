    <h1>Hi. This is my blog</h1>
    <p>
      It is a journey starting right from scratch and we are just going to
      design some web pages and see how it goes. Don't know if I'm going to make
      this the main one but I need to get some practical skills going and I need
      to-I don't know- just muddle my way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficult thing is bridging the gap between passive learning and
      active application. If you think about it, I'm not going to learn stuff
      unless I do it the hard way, but I have a lot of knowledge at my disposal,
      and should really use it. And also, I have to construct a cheatsheet I can
      refer to for starting new projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also need to start lots of projects and maybe design folder templates
      for those projects. Lot's of work, but this is web design, and this is the
      only way I'm going to get tangible skills.
    </p>
    <p>Also, this is an ULTRALEARNING project</p>
    <p>OK, we're back</p>
    <p>
      So I'm going to riff here for a while. This is the homepage. What I really
      need to do is gather ALL my knowledge in one place. I already found a
      surprisingly detailed first attempt, and I've got these everywhere. What I
      found about the previously mentioned site is how badly the files were
      organised. My God most of my efforts are terrible. So I obviously have
      learned <b>something</b> in the past year, but we really need a plan now;
      a repository for youtube videos, one for bookmarks, because they are
      really useful. found quite a few hidden in one of these old projects. Also
      need to dig up some old ones and put them on Github. Fucken hell. This
      requires a LOT of organisation. I think, hard drive, dedicated
      files/folders. Get it all in the one place, load it into the website. Then
      I have to digitise some of my artwork, then probably some photography, and
      maybe blog my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how do we actually do this? Where do we start, and how do we fit this
      into the day, because this is a long term project and I need to be
      coordinated. I guess the hard drive is key, but I need to keep track of
      where I am at.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all honesty it is starting to look like the code is the easy part. That
      said, a folder/file structure is paramount. I really need to make sure
      this makes sense. So the coding is going to be the easy, fun part. Go
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well first up I've cloned a website from github, so I can just copy all
      the stuff in those ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      OK I WORKED OUT WHY THERE WAS SO MANY PHOTOS IN 'FIRST' PROJECT; THERE IS
      A <b>RESPONSIVE GALLERY!</b> This is really cool. That's what I do with my
      artworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, I tried to migrate an old project into here but it didn't work. OK
      with that. Think we just have to be smart about storing this stuff in
      Github and just make sure future projects are well named and files are
      well organised. This is quite a big project.
